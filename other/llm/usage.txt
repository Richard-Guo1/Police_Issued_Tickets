This paper, titled *The Effects of COVID-19 on Police Issued Tickets*, examines how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the issuance of traffic tickets by the police. Specifically, it explores the assumption that fewer vehicles on the roads due to lockdown measures would lead to a decrease in ticket issuance. However, the findings indicate a more complex outcome: while there was a reduction in several types of infractions (e.g., aggressive driving and distracted driving), there was a significant surge in speeding violations.

The analysis relies on data sourced from Gelfand (2022) and processed using the R programming environment. The data set includes variables such as ticket type, police division, and offense category, though some data points, such as neighborhood names, were omitted for clarity. The analysis is grounded in a hypothesis that the number of tickets is proportional to traffic volume, but the results show that while non-speeding offenses decreased, speeding offenses tripled, suggesting an inverse relationship between road congestion and speeding.

The paper is structured as follows: it opens with an introduction to the research question and data sources, followed by a detailed presentation of the dataset and its preparation. The core analysis discusses potential causes for the increase in speeding, including speed limit reductions and shifts in policing priorities. Finally, the paper addresses limitations, particularly related to omitted data points, and presents conclusions supported by graphical evidence and statistical trends.

Overall, the paper offers a nuanced understanding of traffic enforcement dynamics during a period of reduced mobility, emphasizing how certain offenses like speeding may be more prevalent when road conditions change dramatically.
