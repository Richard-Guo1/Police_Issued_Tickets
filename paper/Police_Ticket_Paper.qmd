# Introduction

The categories of tickets are Aggressive Driving, All Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act transgressions (All CAIA), Distracted Driving, Other Highway Traffic Act infractions (Other HTA), and speeding. 


# Data {#sec-mydatasection}


```{r}
#| label: tickets-by-year
#| fig-cap: Annual Number of Police Issued Tickets between 2014 and 2023
#| echo: false
  
data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = `Offence Year`, weight = `Ticket Count`, 
             fill = `Offence Category`)) + 
  geom_bar() + labs(y = "Total Tickets") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2014:2023)) + guides(x = guide_axis(angle = 70))

```

Talk more about it.





# Discussion

## Identifying the Cause of Increased Speeding Tickets {#sec-first-point}
- major increase in speeding tickets between 2014-2019 and 2020-2023, aligns with covid lockdown restrictions 
- possible explanation is ppl got used to speeding

```{r}
#| label: tbl-speeding
#| tab-cap: Speeding Tickets Sorted by District and Year
#| echo: false

kable(spd_data)

- other possible explanation is lower speed limits means more speeding
- graph 2019-/2020+ speeding by district
- observations

## second discussion point
-map districts, ticket breakdown, year


## Limitations
A significant portion of the data had to be thrown out as either the police division or district number had no specified address (NSA).
